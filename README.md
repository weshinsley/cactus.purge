# cactus.purge

## Introduction

Most of this package has been written while waiting for data processing tasks
to complete; data tasks that have been necessary to do mostly daily for the
past year or so. A need therefore arose for relaxing therapeutic energy
outlet, and no other suitable R package was found.

## Execution

* For now, you'll need my customised branch of keypress:-
  `devtools::install_github("weshinsley/keypress", ref="wes/cp_fixes")`

* Open a terminal, or a Windows Command Prompt. On windows, you will need
  to have RScript.exe in you path.

* `./run` in a linux terminal, or `Rscript run` on windows to begin.
