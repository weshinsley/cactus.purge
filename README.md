# cactus.purge

## Introduction

Most of this package has been written while waiting for data processing tasks
to complete; data tasks that have been necessary to do mostly daily for the
past year or so. A need therefore arose for relaxing therapeutic energy
outlet, and no other suitable R package was found.

## Execution

* Install the package with devtools::install_github("weshinsley/cactus.purge")
* Open a terminal or a Windows Command Prompt, of size 80 x 30 characters or more.
On Mac/Linux I believe you just drag the size out. On Windows, right click on the
top of the Command Prompt, Proprties, Layout tab, and set Windows Size there.
* From your terminal/command prompt: `Rscript -e "cactus.purge::launch()"`
