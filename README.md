# cactus.purge

## Introduction

Most of this package has been written while waiting for data processing tasks
to complete; data tasks that have been necessary to do mostly daily for the
past year or so. A need therefore arose for relaxing therapeutic energy
outlet, and no other suitable R package was found.

## DEV TO FIX

* At present, you need to be in the cactus.purge folder, because the hiscore
file will be expected to be in `data/`

## Execution

* devtools::install_github("weshinsley/cactus.purge@cactz")
* Open a terminal or a Windows Command Prompt, of size 80 x 30 characters or more.
* For Linux `./run`
* For Windows, you'll need Rscript in your path, and then `Rscript run` to begin.
