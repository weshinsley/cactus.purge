[0m                                                            
[0m A faint whirring sound shook Kenny from his afternoon nap. 
[0m Turning his cact-eyes to the sky, he spied a small, yellow 
[0m machine, heading for him with [34;1mominously decaying[0m altitude. 
[0m He squinted harder. "Cessna 172. I knew it!" he exclaimed. 
[0m "IT IS HAPPENING AGAIN! [31;1mTHE SNAZZY PLOTS![0m FLY YOU FOOLS!"  
[0m                                                            
[0m Hastily Kenny strapped on his skis and plunged ferociously 
[0m into [33;1mThe Passage of Perpendicular Dismemberment[0m, which led 
[0m to the Giant Cactus Head Quarters. It is a treacherous and 
[0m well-defended path; Kenny wondered if they might get a few 
[0m more tourists if they took a more welcoming approach.      
[0m                                                            
[0m But, he was digressing. He had to get to GCHQ to warn them 
[0m of their fate. The whirring becaome a whistling of falling 
[0m bombs. He [34;1mgritted his prickles[0m and fled. In a bizarre plot 
[0m twist, you must guide Kenny towards safety. Extensive maps 
[0m are availa - oh bother, that's our [32;1mrow limit[0m. Sorry.
