 [0mhad [31;1menough[0m. She jumped into her Cessna 172 and flew out to 
 [0mdo some on-site Yellow Fever research. Unfortunately, back 
 [0mat the aerodrome, a batch of [32;1mpoorly formatted dates[0m caused 
 [0ma failure in the fuelling system which was not spotted, as 
 [0mthe human validator was struck down with gout. Before long 
 [0mthe engine spluttered, and Katy had no option but to glide 
 [0mtowards an emergency landing in a field of cacti.          
                                                            
 [0mFortunately, due to a subtle [33;1mdivide-by-zero[0m bug lurking in 
 [0mthe cargo loading algorithm, Katy found the plane had been 
 [0mfitted with an infinite supply of bombs. Maybe, just maybe 
 [0mshe could [34;1mpurge the cacti[0m in time for a safe landing.      
                                                            
 [0mPush SPACE to drop a bomb. That's it. And due to a strange 
 [0mtwist in the plot that never gets adequately explained, if 
 [0myou do land safely, try again with lankier cacti and a new 
 [0mand speedier plane, that still has no fuel.
