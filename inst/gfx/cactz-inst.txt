 had [31;1menough[0m. She jumped into her Cessna 172 and flew out to 
 do some on-site Yellow Fever research. Unfortunately, back 
 at the aerodrome, a batch of [32;1mpoorly formatted dates[0m caused 
 a failure in the fueling system, which was not spotted, as 
 the human validator was struck down with gout. Before long 
 the engine spluttered, and Katy had no option but to glide 
 towards an emergency landing in a field of cacti.         
                                                            
 Fortunately, due to a subtle [33;1mdivide-by-zero[0m bug lurking in 
 the cargo loading algorithm, Katy found the plane had been 
 fitted with an infinite supply of bombs. Maybe, just maybe 
 she could [34;1mpurge the cacti[0m in time for a safe landing.     
                                                            
 Push SPACE to drop a bomb. That's it. And due to a strange 
 twist in the plot that never gets adequately explained, if 
 you do land safely, try again with lankier cacti and a new 
 and speedier plane, that still has no fuel.
